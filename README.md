# Mbed_bme280
Modified library for the BME280 atmospheric sensor.
Most of this library came from a library found on Mbed. The author is credited as Kevin Braun.
The rest of the library came from the SparkFun Arduino library.

This library had to be modified to work with the ARM architecture. It is currently unteset.
